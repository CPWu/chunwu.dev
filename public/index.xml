      <description>Where have I been? In the previous iteration of this website (there have been many iterations before it). I was running chunwu.dev using Hugo. The site was hosted in Azure Storage and leveraged Azure&amp;rsquo;s Content Delivery Network.&#xA;My hope was that by having a web presence, it would force me to blog about all the various things I am working on - as they say, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand a topic until you can teach it.</description>
