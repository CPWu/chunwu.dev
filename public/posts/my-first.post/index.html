<p>In the previous iteration of this website (there have been many iterations before it). I was running <a href="https://chunwu.dev">chunwu.dev</a> using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The site was hosted in Azure Storage and leveraged Azure&rsquo;s Content Delivery Network.</p>
<p>My hope was that by having a web presence, it would force me to blog about all the various things I am working on - as they say, you don&rsquo;t understand a topic until you can teach it. With the goal that I would share some knowledge and inspire the next person, as many have done for me. The Problem&hellip; blogging requires time and commitment.</p>
<p>In the last 4 years, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>made a huge pivot in my career.</li>
<li>moved to another country.</li>
<li>got married.</li>
<li>And most recently, my wife and I welcomed our son - Aiden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-am-i-trying-to-achieve">What am I trying to achieve?</h3>
<p>My personal goal is to have a miniaturized version of the PaaS (Platform as a Service) environment that I am developing at scale for work. Whenever you work on projects that have the scale that I typically work at, we do not typically get the opportunity to work on all aspects of the platform - as there is just too much to do. Building my homelab would help me understand various technologies in detail and if something breaks, I will at least have an idea how to triage.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-i-done-so-far">What have I done so far?</h3>
<p>Up to this point, I am running a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> cluster using 4 Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB. It is configured using one node as the Control Plane and 3 nodes for the data plane. I have a few stateless applications running that have been exposed to the internet using Cloudflare&rsquo;s Zero Trust tunnel, and a monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana and Alert Manager.</p>
<p>If this all sounds interesting to you, great! The existing infrastructure is a bit janky and is a major motivation for today&rsquo;s post.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h3>
<p>Initially when I completed custom writing a blogging solution using Python and the Flask framework to kick things off, I encountered my first hurdle. Every time I made a breaking change to my homelab the data would be wiped.</p>
<p>So, as a temporary solution until my homelab stabilizes, I will be using Hugo once again which I will host using Github Pages made available from my custom DNS.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for weekly posts!</p>
