It will please some of you to know that I almost titled this post "I am Chun." But friends in my life consistently knock me down a few pegs as a gentle reminder to be humble - which I am and prefer to be. You know who you are. 

As an individual I seek to better myself and further my knowledge in all areas of life but my passion remains constant. Technology through digital transformation to contribute to society. A little about me. I am a Technical Advisor in the Canadian federal government, working with a brilliant team that (which keeps me on my toes as well as provides me hope that the public sector is capable of driving change) focuses on Cloud Native. We embrace all the buzzwords, (devops, microservices, containers, etc.) and would like to believe that we are pioneering the approach across the federal workspace. Aside from this, I work for one of top 10 Fortune 500 companies in various capacties over the last several years. Finally, over the last two years I have taught at the local college in their Advanced Computing Technology diploma, which I suppose in-part made me realize a few things.

1. I am and will always be a lifelong learner. 
2. Teaching allowed me to exercise my creativity to adapt my methods to various students.
3. Empowerment. Across all my jobs and even more so while teaching. The impactfulness of empowering even one indivdidual from the difference you can make as an indvidiaul is profound.

I have no idea of what will come from this and or how often I can commit to this given my various committments but know this. I am the type of individual if you asked me to change your brakes, I will most likely take a part the car first.
