      <description>It will please some of you to know that I almost titled this post &amp;ldquo;I am Chun.&amp;rdquo; But friends in my life consistently knock me down a few pegs as a gentle reminder to be humble - which I am and prefer to be. You know who you are.
As an individual I seek to better myself and further my knowledge in all areas of life but my passion remains constant.</description>
