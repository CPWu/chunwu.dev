## Ansible

As I am aware that this will not be the last time I will rebuild this cluster (I plan setup HA on the controlplane at a later time)I need a way to automate and simplify the cluster rebuild process each time. Enter Ansible. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies complex IT tasks. Written in Python, it allows you to automate various operations, such as system configuration, software deployment, and workflow orchestration. Ansibleâ€™s strengths lie in its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for managing infrastructure and achieving operational excellence across different platforms
